# loads packages needed
# R pacakges contain useful functions to analyze data
# install a package before first using it for the first time
# to install a package, click the "package" tab in the lower right pane and click "install"

# lego.csv can be found under "resources" on Sakai.
# lego.csv must be saved in the same folder as this notebook!

lego <- read_csv("lego.csv") # read_csv is a pre-written function in the package "readr"

# lego.csv is read by R as "lego" and stored in the format of dataframe
# Shows the variables and first 6 cases (by default)

```
```{r}
# use dataframe$variable_name to extract one variable in the data
lego$Price
```

```{r}
# setting na.rm=TRUE to remove observations with NA in the calculation of mean and median
mean(amazon_prices, na.rm=TRUE)
median(amazon_prices, na.rm=TRUE)
```

```{r}
# making histograms and boxplots of each variable to learn the shape of distrbutions.
hist(amazon_prices)
boxplot(amazon_prices, horizontal = TRUE)
```

```{r}
# use which() to extract interesting observations 
which(lego$Amazon_Price == 699.95)

```


```{r}
# Assignment operators in R: = vs. <-
xbar = mean(lego$Amazon_Price, na.rm=TRUE)
m = median(lego$Amazon_Price, na.rm=TRUE)

residxbar = lego$Amazon_Price - xbar
residm = lego$Amazon_Price - m
```

```{r}
# returns NA because we used lego$Amazon_Price to assign values in residxbar and residm
sum(residxbar^2, na.rm=TRUE)
```

```{r}
# using subset() to remove NA Amazon_Prices
lego_rm_AP_na = subset(lego, is.na(Amazon_Price)==FALSE)
```

```{r}
# Assignment operators in R: = vs. <-

```

```{r}
# no problem now. why does residxbar lead to a smaller sum of squared errors? 

```

```{r}
# other useful functions to describe the data.

```

```{r}
# extract observations from two themes using subset()
# "|" represents "or" and "&" represents "and"

```

```{r}
# two-sample t test

```

```{r}
# boxplot comparison of the two themes. any visible difference?

```

```{r}
# export data with write.csv()
```
